# Sentiment Analysis with ML Models

Sentiment Analysis, a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP), involves text classification to determine sentiments such as positive, negative, happy, sad, or neutral within text data. Its goal is to discern the underlying sentiment in text, commonly found in social media and other platforms, a field also known as Opinion Mining.

## Project Overview
